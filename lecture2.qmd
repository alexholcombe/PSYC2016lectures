<!--As for the format of the quizzes, we canâ€™t sit all people in the Monday class, so I give the quiz question at the end and will explain it first thing on tuesday.  The quiz question is open until 3pm Tuesday.  For the Tuesday and Thursday class, the quiz opens at the start, but I explain it after it closes at 3:50pm. I have found setting an alarm on my phone for 3:50 (or a bit later) works well to ensure that I get to it before running out of time.-->

## Organization of Alex's material

> Can the lecture be downloaded as PDF?

Yes.

<BR>
->Tools->PDF Export

##

> What's the point of the lectures if everything is in the mini-text?

<BR>
Lectures:

-   Go over the same concepts but with different examples and wording
-   Thanks to the mini-text, can address issues that come up without worrying I shouldn't because I'd run out of time
-   Show demos
-   Quiz you and solicit your personal experiences

## Binocular rivalry versus dual letters

-   Binocular rivalry: different stimuli presented to the two eyes
    -   Processed in parallel to a point
    -   *Incompatible*: Brain expects the same object in both eyes, therefore
    -   Direct competition for a single location, and winner occurs relatively early
    
-   Dual letters in different locations
    -   No incompatibility, so *processed in parallel until bottleneck*
    -   Competition only because high-level processing is limited in capacity

## Global neuronal workspace theory

![](images/AlaisSlide36Consciousness2globalNeuralWorkspace.png){width=100%}

-   There's a bottleneck prior to the frontal lobe
-   If a stimulus gets through, it results in reverberating widespread activity associated with that stimulus

## Bottom-up attention

## Bottom-up attention

-   Salient stimuli
    -   But what is salient? Different than other stimuli in terms of low-level features, see Chapters 7 and 9 <!--Should add comment to book that the fact that visual search is limited to individual features etc. also means gorillas don't capture our attention-->
-   Intense stimuli
-   Good for vigilance
    -   Basic alerting system, like a smoke alarm.
    -   A smoke alarm is pretty dumb, but doesn't take much resources and it's cheap to run it all the time.

::: notes

:::

## Top-down attention

-   Sometimes called *endogenous* attention
  -   Internally driven
-   Goal directed
-   Can require effort to maintain

## Combination of top-down and bottom-up 

![](images/brainBottomupTopdownTheeuwesFailing.png)
::: notes
What we attend to reflects a combination of things we are voluntarily (endogenously) directing our attention to and things that exogenously capture our attention

## Homework: The distraction diary


To do when you have ten minutes or more to concentrate on studying or other computer work.

-   Put your phone on airplane mode.
-   Turn off notifications on your computer if you know how.
-   Start the stopwatch (often in Clock in Android).
-   Press "lap" every time you can't help yourself and you check social media, the news, or otherwise get off task.

::: notes :::
Try not to think of this as homework,
You should be reading the mini-text anyway, so why not let it do double duty as a self-insight exercise.
::: 

<!--Create Google Doc to enter data-->

## Practice: Let's spend 5 minutes reading the mini-text

Then we'll answer some questions from it.

Chapter 7: Three kinds of attentional selection.

::: notes

I know not everyone is going to do the exercise but please don't interfering with other people.
Start the stopwatch "NOW"

## Chapter 7: Combinations of features can't be directly selected

-   Features are processed somewhat separately by the brain.
-   Conjoining them requires a capacity-limited process


## Chapter 7: Feature selection is compulsorily global.

![](images/redBlueFeatureLocationSelectionCantBeCombined.png)

::: notes
Global facilitation of attended features is obligatory and restricts divided attention. Anderson et al.
They showed this with EEG 
::: 

## Chapter 7: Feature selection is compulsorily global

Difficult to attend to red shapes on left while simultaneously attending to blue shapes on right.

The *combination* of location and feature selection can't be done.

You can either select a simple feature everywhere (e.g., red objects),
or select the stimuli in a particular region, but you can't combine those two abilities.

## Combining location and feature selection can't be done

Probably due to separation of what and where pathways.
