<!--As for the format of the quizzes, we can’t sit all people in the Monday class, so I give the quiz question at the end and will explain it first thing on tuesday.  The quiz question is open until 3pm Tuesday.  For the Tuesday and Thursday class, the quiz opens at the start, but I explain it after it closes at 3:50pm. I have found setting an alarm on my phone for 3:50 (or a bit later) works well to ensure that I get to it before running out of time.-->

## VIGILANCE {background-image="images/wallabyCampsitePittwater.JPG" background-opacity=".3"}

  * For ecologists, *vigilance* is monitoring surroundings for predators
  * Hard to get close to wallabies. Why? Vigilance.
  * The arrival of predators is an example of something that can be more important than whatever an animal is doing

::: notes
The importance of vigilance is 

This wallaby has been taking handouts from campsites, this one in North Sydney, for a long time, so it was easy to get close to it.

Have you ever tried to sneak up on a wallaby or a kangaroo?
They're not the hardest animals to sneak up on. The haven't evolved to be very vigilant. Not many predators historically.

  * Because of predators many animals (including most mammals!) are nocturnal.


::: notes
How many of you grew up in Australia?
Raise your hand if you've seen a platypus in the wild? Not many of you have.

If you're only active at night, you have to worry much less about predators spotting you

## Nocturnal ancestors {background-image="images/Velociraptor_UDLwikimedia.png" background-size="1200px"  background-opacity="0.3"}

  * Prior to the dinosaurs, our ancestors had vision specialized for daytime.
  * During the dinosaurs, our ancestors shifted into the night

  * ![](images/640px-Brasilitherium_riograndensis.jpg){width=20%}

::: notes

Our ancestors evolved during a period when dinosaurs were the dominant daytime predators. This period forced early mammals to adopt a nocturnal lifestyle to avoid predation.

## Concentration vs. vigilance

  * Solution 1: Alternate between concentrating and looking around
  * Solution 2: Have a system for overcoming concentration with potentially-important signals
  
::: notes
The drive behind the first solution is one thing that can make it hard to concentrate.
Today we'll start talking about the second solution.
:::

## Computers were not designed with vigilance in mind

::: notes
Have you ever had your computer freeze on you?
Like you're using Microsoft Word to write a document or something, and then the app just stops responding?
:::

## Computer scientists created "interrupt signals"

- Keystroke interrupt signal
  - Option-Command-ESC (MacOS); Alt-F4 (Windows)

![](images/forceQuit.png){width="800"}

::: notes
Computers used to freeze a lot more. With a lot of advances in operating system technology
to stop the concentration on another task.

Alex, you put the question on TextEdit to avoid it appearing on the web lecture slides!
<!--
One reason our brains have a vigilance system is:

  A) To facilitate staying on a single task
  B) To detect predators
  C) To maximize concentration during school
  D) To improve invigilation during exams
  E) To better digest vegetables
-->

::: notes
the Lecture Quiz is a glorified attendance/self-assessment activity, so students will be verbally walked through the MCQ by the lecturer and surveyed for what they think the answer is, then they are told what it actually is, and that’s what they enter in Canvas

## Does not compute! {background-image="images/8Ois.gif"}

::: notes
Unlike computers, we had to evolve so that we don't have "Does not compute" moments where we just stay stuck on a single task, or freeze 

Humans basically never freeze. Because that would have been too detrimental during evolution.

## Bottom-up attention {background-image="images/monster.png" background-opacity="0.1"}

-   "Salient" stimuli
-   What is salient to us?
    - Different than other stimuli in terms of low-level features, see Chapters 7 and 9 <!--Should add comment to book that the fact that visual search is limited to individual features etc. also means gorillas don't capture our attention qua gorillas-->
    -   Intense stimuli
-   Good for vigilance
    -   Basic alerting system, like a smoke alarm.
    -   A smoke alarm is dumb, but requires few resources. Cheap to run it all the time.

::: notes
This has been one of the big projects in the study of visual attention, to work out what can generate an interrupt signal

Part of the way this works is 
So we do have a system f
:::

## Top-down attention

-   Sometimes called *endogenous* attention
  -   Internally driven
-   Goal directed
-   Can require effort to maintain

## Combination of top-down and bottom-up 

![](images/brainBottomupTopdownTheeuwesFailing.png)

::: notes
What we attend to reflects a combination of things we are voluntarily (endogenously) directing our attention to and things that exogenously capture our attention 
:::

## Ways to select a stimulus

-   Spatial/object selection
-   Feature selection

## Chapter 7: Combinations of features can't be directly selected

-   Features are processed somewhat separately by the brain.
-   Conjoining them requires a capacity-limited process

::: notes
See chapter 7

## Chapter 7: Feature selection is compulsorily global

![](images/redBlueFeatureLocationSelectionCantBeCombined.png)

::: notes
Need to make better (sparser?) version of this.

Global facilitation of attended features is obligatory and restricts divided attention. Anderson et al.
They showed this with EEG 
::: 

## Chapter 7: Feature selection is compulsorily global

Difficult to attend to red shapes on left while simultaneously attending to blue shapes on right.

The *combination* of location and feature selection can't be done.

You can either select a simple feature everywhere (e.g., red objects),
or select the stimuli in a particular region, but you can't combine those two abilities.

## Compulsorily global: Combining location and feature selection can't be done

Possibly due to separation of what and where pathways.

::: notes :::
I ad-libbed about how it makes sense that object recognition doesn't need location information much, whereas location is more important for action.
