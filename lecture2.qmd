<!--As for the format of the quizzes, we can’t sit all people in the Monday class, so I give the quiz question at the end and will explain it first thing on tuesday.  The quiz question is open until 3pm Tuesday.  For the Tuesday and Thursday class, the quiz opens at the start, but I explain it after it closes at 3:50pm. I have found setting an alarm on my phone for 3:50 (or a bit later) works well to ensure that I get to it before running out of time.-->



## Lecture 1 CLEAN-UP and REVIEW

## Organization of Alex's material

> Can the lecture be downloaded as PDF?

Yes.

->Tools->PDF Export

##

> What's the point of the lectures if everything is in the mini-text?
<BR>
Lectures:

-   Go over the same concepts but with different examples and wording
-   Thanks to the mini-text, can address issues that come up without worrying I shouldn't because I'd run out of time
-   Show demos
-   Quiz you and solicit your personal experiences

## Binocular rivalry versus dual letters

-   Binocular rivalry: different stimuli presented to the two eyes
    -   Processed in parallel to a point
    -   *Incompatible*: Brain expects the same object in both eyes, therefore
    -   Direct competition for a single location, and winner occurs relatively early
    
-   Dual letters in different locations
    -   No incompatibility, so *processed in parallel until bottleneck*
    -   Competition only because high-level processing is limited in capacity

## Global neuronal workspace theory

![](images/AlaisSlide36Consciousness2globalNeuralWorkspace.png){width=100%}

-   There's a bottleneck prior to the frontal lobe
-   If a stimulus gets through, it results in reverberating widespread activity associated with that stimulus

## Homework: The distraction diary


Do it when you have ten minutes or more to concentrate on studying or other computer work.

-   Put your phone on airplane mode.
-   Turn off notifications on your computer if you know how.
-   Start the stopwatch (often in Clock in Android).
-   Press "lap" every time you can't help yourself and you check social media, the news, or otherwise get off task.

::: notes :::
Try not to think of this as homework,
You should be reading the mini-text anyway, so why not let it do double duty as a self-insight exercise.

<!--Create Google Doc to enter data-->

## Practice: Let's spend 5 minutes reading the mini-text

Then we'll answer some questions from it.

Chapter 7: Three kinds of attentional selection.

::: notes

I know not everyone is going to do the exercise but please don't interfering with other people.
Start the stopwatch "NOW"

## Chapter 7: Combinations of features can't be directly selected

-   Features are processed somewhat separately by the brain.
-   Conjoining them requires a capacity-limited process


## Chapter 7: location versus feature selection

Feature selection is global. You can't do it locally!

![](images/redBlueFeatureLocationSelectionCantBeCombined.png)

::: notes
Global facilitation of attended features is obligatory and restricts divided attention. Anderson et al.
They showed this with EEG 
::: 

## Chapter 7: location versus feature selection

Difficult to perceive cluster of red shapes on left while simultaneously perceiving cluster of blue shapes on right.

The *combination* of location and feature selection can't be done.

You can either select a simple feature everywhere (e.g., red objects),
or select the stimuli in a particular region, but you can't combine those two abilities.

![](images/redBlueFeatureLocationSelectionCantBeCombined.png){width=40%}


## Combining location and feature selection can't be done

Probably because of separation of what and where pathways.

## Quiz question from Lecture 1

> why didn't see second letter

Why was "I missed that" the right answer


## Bottleneck

Limited processing capacity

## Alex White words paper

## Bottom-up and top-down selection

Deciding which info goes hrough the bottleneck

## Remember this?

## How is info prioritized at the bottleneck?

## Reading-order prioritisation

## Consciousness and attention

Global Neuronal Workspace theory:
"Attention and consciousness are the same process"

-- David Alais' slide #40 of Consciousness lecture 2

::: notes
You're not conscious of anything except what you are attending to.
Whereas the Recurrent Processing Theory says you're conscious of the whole visual field in a rich way.
This is a hard part of consciousness to explain, because when we probe what people are seeing, it seems like they're not seeing much (change blindness)

This actually may be part of the non-selective pathway.

## DISTRACTION

## What most distracts you doing lecture?

![](images/distractionsDuringLectureCensored.png)
::: notes
Some of these are bottom-up sensory events
Some are ongoing life concerns (top-down)
Some are basic drives (hunger)
:::

## 

All day, the world makes its demands. There's so much of it, world

begging to be noticed.

ultrawhelmed
sensorium, my self  

taxed with being a self, brimming with living’s rowdy mechanics and disruptions
unremitting, a thought flits by, then another (an unpaid bill, a jingle’s tenacious refrain)—and,
... I attend, as best I can,...  
yielding to the most persuasive god, the most recent, to each thing I say Yes? Yes!—
zealot of whatever calls me next.

::: notes
It was actually called "A poem for Sunday" and on a Sunday there can be a joy in this.
Mindfulness or living in the moment

Computers used to freeze all the time. With a lot of advances in operating system technology

## In a future class, bump up the distraction diary to keeping phone on as normal aand recording notification checks

## CONTROLLING BOTTOM-UP SENSORY EVENTS

## Turn off phone notifications!

## Earplugs

Don't be a passive victim of your animal nature!

What do you do to shut out the world?

> To pay attention, this is our endless and proper work

- Lecture 2
	- People have known about distraction for thousands of years
		- Buddhism. Are you a victim of your attentional mechanisms?
		- Flash a bunch of self-help book images.
		- animals for millions
	- “What in this image attracts your attention?” Gradual transition from salience to more goal-directed
- My story
	- Like many others, I spend too much time on social media.
	- Tried apps that stopped me from using the internet.
	- Fall off the wagon
	- The Pomodoro method - preserve the rewards, but delay them so you have more uninterrupted work session.
	
	Come back to dual-letters and explain left advantage
