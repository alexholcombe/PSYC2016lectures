<!--sometimes have to turn multiplex false to load speaker notes -->

<!--As for the format of the quizzes, we canâ€™t sit all people in the Monday class, so I give the quiz question at the end and will explain it first thing on tuesday.  The quiz question is open until 3pm Tuesday.  For the Tuesday and Thursday class, the quiz opens at the start, but I explain it after it closes at 3:50pm. I have found setting an alarm on my phone for 3:50 (or a bit later) works well to ensure that I get to it before running out of time.-->




## Find a study on how repeated events or learned events become less distracting I ALREADY HAVE ASPLUND IN THE BOOK

The dog's bark changes rapidly and has a chaotic rhythm. If it was a constant repetition and rhythm, you'd anticipate it well and could suppress it better.

## What is conjunction search?

(SOCRATIV)
Not just that the target is a feature pair, but also that the distractors have both features


## Binding motion vectors together also

## Bottom-up and top-down selection

Deciding which info goes through the bottleneck

## Remember this?

<!-- {{< video images/2targets4timesFaster.mov >}} -->

## How is info prioritized at the bottleneck?

-   Bottom-up / endogenous / stimulus-driven salience
-   Current plans
-   Automatic routines
    -   reading

## Reading-order prioritisation

::: notes
You're not conscious of anything except what you are attending to. Whereas the Recurrent Processing Theory says you're conscious of the whole visual field in a rich way. This is a hard part of consciousness to explain, because when we probe what people are seeing, it seems like they're not seeing much (change blindness)

This actually may be part of the non-selective pathway.

## Bottlenecks ([Section 3.4](https://psyc2016.whatanimalssee.com/bottlenecks.html#bottleneckObjects) of mini-text)

-   For identifying two features from two different objects
-   For identifying features that belong to the same object

THIS DIDN'T MAKE SENSE
Bottleneck for feature binding and for reporting features from two different objects
