## Binocular rivalry versus dual letters
-   Binocular rivalry: different stimuli presented to the two eyes
    -   Processed in parallel to a point
    -   *Incompatible*: brain expects the same object in both eyes, therefore
    -   Direct competition for a single location, and winner occurs relatively early
-   Dual letters in different locations
    -   No incompatibility, so *processed in parallel until bottleneck*, then compete for that

::: notes :::
He told you about it because useful for studying consciousness because stimulus doesn't change

## Global neuronal workspace theory

![](images/AlaisSlide36Consciousness2globalNeuralWorkspace.png){width=100%}

-   There's a bottleneck prior to the frontal lobe
-   If a stimulus gets through, it results in reverberating widespread activity associated with that stimulus

Global Neuronal Workspace theory: "Attention and consciousness are the same process"

## Consciousness

::: notes
The topic of consciousness hopefully is fresh in your mind, because of this guy.

## What happens when a stimulus location is selected?

-   Activity makes it through the bottleneck
-   Recurrent activity

## What happens when a spatial location is selected?

Why can't we be conscious of all stimuli?

::: notes
Spatial selection facilitates stimuli getting through the bottleneck.
