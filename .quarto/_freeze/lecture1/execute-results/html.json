It is the taking possession by the mind, in a clear and vivid form of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration of consciousness are of its essence. It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal with others.\n```\n\n```\n-\tWilliam James (1890)\n```\n:::notes\nThe first great scientific psychologist. Do you think I could grow a beard like his?\n:::\n\n## \"It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal with others\" - William James\n\n-   This is the part that we sometimes don't like!\n\n::: {.fragment}\n![](images/LeavingAFlatTasteInYourMouth.png)\n:::\n\n::: notes\nInteresting example. Lot of consequences.\n:::\n\n## English expressions\n\n-   Please “pay attention!”\n-   “Sorry, I wasn’t listening”\n-   “Sorry, I missed that.”\n-   “I didn’t notice that.”\n::: notes\nWhat do you mean you weren't listening? How come your ears being open isn't enough?\nWe have limited resources.\n:::\n## Why?\n\n-   Why do we need selective attention?\n-   Why do we get distracted?\n\n::: notes\nBy the end of these 5 lectures you'll understand distraction better\n:::\n\n## Organisation\n\n-   The mini-text: PSYC2016.whatanimalssee.com\n-   These slides: linked from Canvas\n-   The Week 5 tutorial: Finding and noticing things in the lab, and in the real world\n\n::: notes\nDuring the pandemic. I recognized that 50-minute lecture videos were not the best way to communicate things.\nLecturing was very depressing then.\nSo I wrote this mini-text.\n:::\n\n## I can't be everywhere at once!\n\n-   Implies selection\n\n## I can't do everything at once!\n\n-   Only have two hands.

But on the other hand, it's had millions of years to evolve. So we rarely freeze.\n:::\n\n## Your turn\n\nMentimer: PSYC2016gettingToKnowYou\n\n## Homework: The distraction diary\n\n![](images/usingTheStopwatch.jpeg)\n\nFor when you have ten minutes or more to concentrate on studying or other computer work.\n\n-   Put your phone on airplane mode.\n-   Turn off notifications on your computer if you know how.\n-   Start the stopwatch (often in Clock in Android).\n-   Press \"lap\" every time you can't help yourself and you check social media, the news, or otherwise get off task.\n\n<!--Create Google Doc to enter data-->\n\n## In a future class, bump up the distraction diary to keeping phone on as normal aand recording notification checks\n\n## Earplugs\n\nDon't be a passive victim of your animal nature!\n\nWhat do you do to shut out the world?\n\n![](images/threeWiseMonkeys/Three_Wise_Monkeys_640px.jpeg)\n\n## Are you not going to do it because it's not cool?\n\n![](images/masksComfortablePrincessBridge.jpg)\n::: notes\nWhy do you wear a mask, do you have horrible scars?\n:::\n\n## \n\n![](images/earplug.jpg){width=\"40%\"}\n\n::: notes\nBut you know what, you don't have to wait\n:::\n\n## MENTIMETER: WHEN HAVE YOU BEEN MOST FOCUSED?\n\n## To add to textbook\n\nSelective vs. non-selective pathway.
