## Attention: a bridge between Perception and Cognition  {background-image="images/topicsPerceptionAttentionCognition2024.png" background-opacity="0.5" background-size="460px"}

![](images/bottleneckPerceptionCognition.png){width="15%"}

-   Our mental architecture is massively-parallel, followed by bottleneck(s)
-   To deal with this architecture, we have:
    -   Crude salience and alerting mechanisms
    -   Guidance of attention by memory
-   This helps explain distractions



::: notes :::
Our animal natures
Now we can think in more informed way about distraction
:::


## Outline of Lectures 1-4 {.smaller background-image="images/threeWiseMonkeys/640.jpg" background-opacity="0.07"}

::: {.nonincremental}

1. Why we need selective attention
    -   Overt attention
    -   Bottleneck architecture of the visual system necessitates covert attention
    -   Need for vigilance
        -   Because of bottleneck, we evolved crude salience and alerting mechanisms
    
2. and 3. Kinds of selection, parallel versus serial processing
    -   Bottom-up attention (Chapters 7 and 9)
    -   Our behavior reflects competition between top-down and bottom-up
    -   Combinations of features typically aren't processed in parallel
        -   Selective attention is needed to combine features (Treisman)
    -   Feature selection is compulsorily global
        -   Maybe because What processing (features) occurs on different pathway than Where pathway, which mediates spatial attention

<BR>

4. Shape
    -   Combining features within a feature dimension
    -   Quantifying shape processing efficiency with dipoles

<BR>

4. Change blindness
    -   In blank screen sandwiches, have to attend to location to detect change
    -   A "grand illusion" of visual experience?
    -   Poor peripheral vision can prevent change detection
    -   Role of flicker / motion detectors
    -   Memory for important locations can drive attention

2,3. Kinds of selection, parallel versus serial processing

-   In 1990, imagine I told you that I was going to invent a sinister tool...

- As people used it, their attention spans would degrade, as the tool would constantly shift their focus, weakening their powers of concentration and contemplation.

-   This tool would show people whatever it is they found most difficult to look away from — which would often be what was most threatening about the world, from the worst ideas of their political opponents to the deep injustices of their society.

-   It would fit in their pockets and glow on their night stands and never truly be quiet; there would never be a moment when people could be free of the sense that the pile of messages and warnings and tasks needed to be checked.

-   What would you have thought this engine of distraction, division, and cognitive fracture would do to humanity?

## Molly Worthen on monastic uns {background-image="images/threeWiseMonkeys/640.jpg" background-opacity="0.05"}

We need an intervention: ... a bold move to put the screens, the pinging notifications and the creepy humanoid A.I. chatbots in their proper place. They are our tools, not our masters. That doesn’t mean a futile attempt to wall off higher education from the modern world; it does mean selectively returning to the university’s roots in the monastic schools of medieval Europe and rekindling the old-fashioned quest for meaning.

Colleges should offer a radically low-tech first-year program for students who want to apply: a secular monastery within the modern university, with a curated set of courses that ban glowing rectangles of any kind from the classroom. Students could opt to live in dorms that restrict technology, too.

The first step is dethroning the small silicon idol in their pocket — and making space for the uncomfortable silence and questions that follow. The experience stuck with Ms. Ouyang, the nursing major. “I didn’t look forward to getting my phone back,” she said.
