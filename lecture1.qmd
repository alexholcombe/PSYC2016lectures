All day, the world makes its demands. There's so much of it, world

begging to be noticed.

This unit can't answer the questions raised by this quote, but it takes on the basic issue of why we have issues with this.

```
Everyone knows what attention is. It is the taking possession by the mind, in a clear and vivid form of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration of consciousness are of its essence. It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal with others.
```

```
-	William James (1890)

Lecturing was very depressing during the pandemic and online

## English expressions

-   Please “pay attention!”
-   “Sorry, I wasn’t listening”
-   “Sorry, I missed that.”
-   “I didn’t notice that.”

## Why?

-   Why do we need selective attention?
-   Why do we get distracted?

::: notes
By the end of these 4 lectures you'll understand distraction better

## Consciousness and attention

Global Neuronal Workspace theory:
"Attention and consciousness are the same process"

-- David Alas' slide 36 of Consciousness 2 

## Ways to select a stimulus

-   Spatial/object selection
-   Feature selection

## What happens when a spatial location is selected?

-   Activity makes it through the bottleneck
-   Recurrent activity

## What happens when a spatial location is selected?

Activity makes it through the bottleneck

On the left, activity doesn't get through the bottleneck.


## What happens when a spatial location is selected?

Recurrent activity

::: notes
How do we strike the balance between looking out for important new things coming from anywhere, and focusing on another task we've decided on

## vigilance

leopard, wild dogs

## Why do we need selective attention?

::: notes
Computers used to freeze all the time. With a lot of advances in operating system technology
:::

## Does not compute... {background-image="images/8Ois.gif"}

::: notes
Your own operating system isn't upgraded as often. But on the other hand, it's had millions of years to evolve. So we rarely freeze.

## Homework: The distraction diary

![](images/usingTheStopwatch.jpeg)

For when you have ten minutes or more to concentrate on studying or other computer work.

-   Put your phone on airplane mode.
-   Turn off notifications on your computer if you know how.
-   Start the stopwatch (often in Clock in Android).
-   Press "lap" every time you can't help yourself and you check social media, the news, or otherwise get off task.

<!--Create Google Doc to enter data-->

## In a future class, bump up the distraction diary to keeping phone on as normal aand recording notification checks

## To add to textbook

Selective vs. non-selective pathway. Add to bottom of change-blindness thing. This is the biggest mystery. But point out limitations to detecting change in scene meaning.

## Visual search

Visual search slides including expertise - xrays,

## For distraction add the taste study in Irina's slides

## Four factors for managing attention
