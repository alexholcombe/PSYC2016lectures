## Attention

## 

All day, the world makes its demands. There's so much of it, world

begging to be noticed.

::: notes
This is something many of us love about the world, but also something that we struggle with.
My lectures take on the basic issue of why we have issues with this.
This is something that fascinates me too, in my daily life, and I do experiments to investigate aspects of it.

## English expressions related to attention {background-image="images/ear.jpg" background-opacity="0.2" background-size="600px" }

-   Please “pay attention!”
-   “Sorry, I wasn’t listening!”
-   “Sorry, I missed that!”
-   “I didn’t notice it!”

::: notes
What do you mean you weren't listening? Were your ears not open?
We have limited resources.

"Everyone knows what attention is. 

It is the taking possession by the mind, in a clear and vivid form of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. 
Focalization, concentration of consciousness are of its essence. It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal with others."

-	William James (1890)

## Why?

-   Why do we need selective attention?
-   Why do we get distracted?

::: notes
By the end of these 5 lectures you'll understand distraction better

I'm lecturing on "From attention to distraction" again this year. Here's a free mini-textbook I wrote for that, reviewing the architecture of sensory processing as well as aspects of evolution to explain why attention is needed and how it works https://psyc2016.whatanimalssee.com/ .

## Organisation of Alex's material

-   The mini-text: PSYC2016.whatanimalssee.com
-   These slides: linked from Canvas
-   The Week 6 tutorial: Finding and noticing things in the lab, and in the real world

::: notes
During the pandemic talking at people on Zoom for 50 minutes was not effective.
Lecturing was very depressing then.
So I wrote this mini-text.
I find it freeing.

## Frequently asked questions

> Can the lecture be downloaded as PDF?

<BR>
Yes.

##

> What's the point of the lectures if everything is in the mini-text?

<BR>
Lectures:

-   Go over the same concepts but with different examples and wording
-   Thanks to the mini-text, can address issues that come up without worrying I'll run out of time
-   Show demos
-   Quiz you, and solicit your personal experiences

## "It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal with others" - William James

-   This is a part that we sometimes don't like!

## "I can't be everywhere at once" {background-image="images/body-silhouette.svg" background-opacity=".2" background-size="800px" }

-   Limit on our abilities, imposed by physics!

## "I can't do everything at once" {background-image="images/body-silhouette.svg" background-opacity=".2" background-size="800px" }

-   Only have two hands
-   Only have one mouth

## Limit imposed by our body {background-image="images/body-silhouette.svg" background-opacity=".2" background-size="800px"}

-   Can only be in one place at a time
-   Can act on only a few things at a time
-   Can look directly at only one thing at a time 

-   *Selection* is required

## But the processing limit is worse than that!

-   Can only *extensively mentally process* simultaneously a limited number of things

## {background-image="images/bottleneckDespite4effectors.png" background-opacity="1" background-size="600px" }

<!-- ![](images/bottleneckDespite4effectors.png){width="50%"}-->

::: notes
You have plenty of resources for simultaneous processing!

Can only extensively mentally process a few things at once

## Attentional selection

-   Can look directly at only one thing at a time
    -   Directing gaze is *overt attention*
-   Can only extensively mentally process a few things at once
    -   Directing mental resources is *covert attention*

## Two letters can be enough to overwhelm capacity

-   Recognizing letters seems effortless. It is effortless, at the conscious level.
-   But that doesn't mean it's easy for our brains!
-   Unconscious processes process the letters enough for consciousness.
-   Or not - a capacity limit means two letters can be too much

## You didn't get both letters right?

-   A rate that is enough to process one letter is too fast for two
-   Selection = choice of which stimulus, or stimuli, to extensively process

::: notes

WHAT-   You must not have been paying attention...?
-   "Paying attention" = devoting your resources to a task.

## {background-image="images/hardQuiz.jpg" background-opacity="0.1"}

The choice of a stimulus for extensive processing is often referred to as 

  A) Bottlenecking
  B) Avoidance
  C) Selection
  D) Winning
  E) Grooming
  
::: notes

What words in common English come closest to, in psychology jargon, selection of stimuli?

a) I am listening (could mean vigilance)
b) I didn't notice that
c) I

What word do we use in psychology to refer to paying attention to one thing instead of another?

If someone didn't get both letters right, which common expression most refers to the reason why?

"I missed it"?

the Lecture Quiz is a glorified attendance/self-assessment activity, so students will be verbally walked through the MCQ by the lecturer and surveyed for what they think the answer is, then they are told what it actually is, and that’s what they enter in Canvas
:::

## Can only extensively process a few things at once

Limited resources;  a bottleneck

![](images/bottleneckDespite4effectors.png){width="40%" .absolute bottom=0 right=100}

::: notes
You have plenty of resources for low-level visual processing!
Once we go through the bottleneck aspect, we can circle back to consciousness.

## Consciousness {background-image="images/Alais.jpg" background-opacity="1.0"}

::: notes
The topic of consciousness hopefully is fresh in your mind, because of this guy.

## Global neuronal workspace theory

![](images/AlaisSlide36Consciousness2globalNeuralWorkspace.png){width=100%}

-   Why can't we be conscious of all stimuli?
-   There's a bottleneck prior to the frontal lobe
-   If a stimulus gets through, it results in reverberating widespread activity associated with that stimulus

<!--
## Consciousness and attention

Global Neuronal Workspace theory: "Attention and consciousness are the same process"

-- David Alais' slide #40 of Consciousness lecture 2
-->


## What happens when a stimulus location is selected?

-   Activity makes it through the bottleneck
-   Recurrent activity

## What happens when a spatial location is selected?

Spatial selection facilitates stimuli getting through the bottleneck.

::: notes
This wallaby has been taking handouts from campsites, this one in North Sydney, for a long time, so it was easy to get close to it.

Have you ever tried to sneak up on a wallaby or a kangaroo?
They're not the hardest animals to sneak up on. The haven't evolved to be very vigilant. Not many predators historically.

How many of you grew up in Australia?

## Deer

![](images/deer/Javan_Deer_East_Java.jpg)

::: notes
Deer aren't native to Australia, and you're unlikely to see them.
But that's not because there aren't a lot around.
They were introduced over a hundred years ago because people thought it would be good to have them hear to hunt and eat.
Even in Sydney, they're in a park near the Georges River.

How do we strike the balance between looking out for important new things coming from anywhere, and focusing on another task we've decided on

Your own operating system isn't upgraded as often. But on the other hand, it's had millions of years to evolve. So we rarely freeze.
