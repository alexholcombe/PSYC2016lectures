<!--sometimes have to turn multiplex false to load speaker notes -->
<!--As for the format of the quizzes, we can’t sit all people in the Monday class, so I give the quiz question at the end and will explain it first thing on tuesday.  The quiz question is open until 3pm Tuesday.  For the Tuesday and Thursday class, the quiz opens at the start, but I explain it after it closes at 3:50pm. I have found setting an alarm on my phone for 3:50 (or a bit later) works well to ensure that I get to it before running out of time.-->

## Attention

## 

All day, the world makes its demands. There's so much of it, world

begging to be noticed.

::: notes
This is something many of us love about the world, but also something that we struggle with.
This unit can't answer the questions raised by this quote, but it takes on the basic issue of why we have issues with this.
This is something that fascinates me too, in my daily life, and I do experiments to investigate aspects of it.

Everyone knows what attention is. It is the taking possession by the mind, in a clear and vivid form of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration of consciousness are of its essence. It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal with others.
```

## "It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal with others" - William James

-   This is the part that we sometimes don't like!

::: notes
Interesting example. Lot of consequences.
:::

## English expressions

-   Please “pay attention!”
-   “Sorry, I wasn’t listening”
-   “Sorry, I missed that.”
-   “I didn’t notice that.”
::: notes
What do you mean you weren't listening? How come your ears being open isn't enough?
We have limited resources.
:::
## Why?

-   Why do we need selective attention?
-   Why do we get distracted?

::: notes
By the end of these 5 lectures you'll understand distraction better

## Organisation

-   The mini-text: PSYC2016.whatanimalssee.com
-   These slides: linked from Canvas
-   The Week 5 tutorial: Finding and noticing things in the lab, and in the real world

::: notes
During the pandemic. I recognized that 50-minute lecture videos were not the best way to communicate things.
Lecturing was very depressing then.
So I wrote this mini-text.

## I can't be everywhere at once

-   Implies selection

## I can't do everything at once

-   Only have two hands. Implies selection.

## Need for selection

-   Can only be in one place at a time
-   Can only act on a few things at a time
-   Can only look directly at one thing at a time 
-   Can only *extensively mentally process* a few things at once

## Attentional selection

-   Can only look directly at one thing at a time
    -   Directing gaze is *overt attention*
-   Can only extensively mentally process a few things at once
    -   Directing mental resources only is *covert attention*

## Can only extensively mentally process a few things at once

Limited resources 

Specifically, a bottleneck

::: notes
You have plenty of resources for low-level visual processing!
Once we go through the bottleneck aspect, we can circle back to consciousness.

## Just two stimuli can be enough to overwhelm capacity

Recognizing letters seems effortless. And it is effortless, at the conscious level!
But that doesn't mean it's easy for our brains!
Make ISIms short enough that starts to be very hard.

## Just two stimuli can overwhelm capacity

-   Recognizing letters seems effortless. And it is effortless, at the conscious level!
-   But that doesn't mean it's easy for our brains!
-   We don't notice the capacity limit in normal circumstances.

## You didn't get both letters right?

-   You must not have been paying attention?
-   "Paying attention" = devoting your resources to a task.

## Quiz time!

::: notes
If someone didn't get both letters right, which common expression most refers to the reason why?

## Consciousness

![](images/Alais.jpg)
::: notes
The topic of consciousness hopefully is fresh in your mind, because of this guy.

## Ways to select a stimulus

-   Spatial/object selection
-   Feature selection

## What happens when a spatial location is selected?

-   Activity makes it through the bottleneck
-   Recurrent activity

## What happens when a spatial location is selected?


![](images/AlaisSlide36Consciousness2globalNeuralWorkspace.png){width=280}

Why can't we be conscious of all stimuli?

::: notes
Spatial selection facilitates stimuli getting through the bottleneck.

## VIGILANCE and LIMITED CAPACITY

Have you ever tried to sneak up on a wallaby or a kangaroo?
:::

## Deer

![](images/deer/Javan_Deer_East_Java.jpg)

::: notes
Deer aren't native to Australia, and you're unlikely to see them.
But that's not because there aren't a lot around.
They were introduced over a hundred years ago because people thought it would be good to have them hear to hunt and eat.
Even in Sydney, they're in a park near the Georges River.

Deer aren't native to Australia, and you're unlikely to see them.

How do we strike the balance between looking out for important new things coming from anywhere, and focusing on another task we've decided on

Computers used to freeze all the time. With a lot of advances in operating system technology

## Does not compute... {background-image="images/8Ois.gif"}

::: notes
Your own operating system isn't upgraded as often. But on the other hand, it's had millions of years to evolve. So we rarely freeze.
