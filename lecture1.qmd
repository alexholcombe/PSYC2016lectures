## Attention

## 

All day, the world makes its demands. There's so much of it, world

begging to be noticed.

::: notes
This is something many of us love about the world, but also something that we struggle with.
This unit can't answer the questions raised by this quote, but it takes on the basic issue of why we have issues with this.
This is something that fascinates me too, in my daily life, and I do experiments to investigate aspects of it.

Everyone knows what attention is. It is the taking possession by the mind, in a clear and vivid form of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration of consciousness are of its essence. It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal with others.
```

-	William James (1890)

## "It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal with others" - William James

-   This is the part that we sometimes don't like!

::: notes
Interesting example. Lot of consequences.
:::

## English expressions

-   Please “pay attention!”
-   “Sorry, I wasn’t listening”
-   “Sorry, I missed that.”
-   “I didn’t notice that.”
::: notes
What do you mean you weren't listening? How come your ears being open isn't enough?
We have limited resources.
:::
## Why?

-   Why do we need selective attention?
-   Why do we get distracted?

::: notes
By the end of these 5 lectures you'll understand distraction better

## Organisation

-   The mini-text: PSYC2016.whatanimalssee.com
-   These slides: linked from Canvas
-   The Week 5 tutorial: Finding and noticing things in the lab, and in the real world

::: notes
During the pandemic. I recognized that 50-minute lecture videos were not the best way to communicate things.
Lecturing was very depressing then.
So I wrote this mini-text.
:::

## I can't be everywhere at once!

-   Implies selection

## I can't do everything at once!

-   Only have two hands. Implies selection.

## Need for selection

-   Can only be in one place at a time
-   Can only act on a few things at a time
-   Can only look directly at one thing at a time 
-   Can only *extensively mentally process* a few things at once

## Attentional selection

-   Can only look directly at one thing at a time
    -   Directing gaze is *overt attention*
-   Can only extensively mentally process a few things at once
    -   Directing mental resources only is *covert attention*

## Can only extensively mentally process a few things at once

Limited resources 

Specifically, a bottleneck

::: notes
You have plenty of resources for low-level visual processing!
Once we go through the bottleneck aspect, we can circle back to consciousness.
:::

## Just two stimuli can be enough to overwhelm capacity

Recognizing letters seems effortless.
We don't notice the capacity limit in normal circumstances.

## Consciousness

## Consciousness and attention

Global Neuronal Workspace theory:
"Attention and consciousness are the same process"

-- David Alais' slide 36 of Consciousness 2 
::: notes
Consciousness may be fresh in your minds
:::
## Ways to select a stimulus

-   Spatial/object selection
-   Feature selection

## What happens when a spatial location is selected?

-   Activity makes it through the bottleneck
-   Recurrent activity

## What happens when a spatial location is selected?

Activity makes it through the bottleneck

![](images/AlaisSlide36Consciousness2globalNeuralWorkspace.png)
On the left, activity doesn't get through the bottleneck.


## What happens when a spatial location is selected?

Recurrent activity

How do we strike the balance between looking out for important new things coming from anywhere, and focusing on another task we've decided on

## Why do we need selective attention?

::: notes
Computers used to freeze all the time. With a lot of advances in operating system technology
:::

## Does not compute... {background-image="images/8Ois.gif"}

::: notes
Your own operating system isn't upgraded as often. But on the other hand, it's had millions of years to evolve. So we rarely freeze.

## Homework: The distraction diary

![](images/usingTheStopwatch.jpeg)

For when you have ten minutes or more to concentrate on studying or other computer work.

-   Put your phone on airplane mode.
-   Turn off notifications on your computer if you know how.
-   Start the stopwatch (often in Clock in Android).
-   Press "lap" every time you can't help yourself and you check social media, the news, or otherwise get off task.

<!--Create Google Doc to enter data-->

## In a future class, bump up the distraction diary to keeping phone on as normal aand recording notification checks

## Earplugs

Don't be a passive victim of your animal nature!

What do you do to shut out the world?

## Are you not going to do it because it's not cool?

## MENTIMETER: WHEN HAVE YOU BEEN MOST FOCUSED?

## To add to textbook

Selective vs. non-selective pathway. Add to bottom of change-blindness thing. This is the biggest mystery. But point out limitations to detecting change in scene meaning.

## Visual search

Visual search slides including expertise - xrays,

## For distraction add the taste study in Irina's slides
