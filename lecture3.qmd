<!--As for the format of the quizzes, we can’t sit all people in the Monday class, so I give the quiz question at the end and will explain it first thing on tuesday.  The quiz question is open until 3pm Tuesday.  For the Tuesday and Thursday class, the quiz opens at the start, but I explain it after it closes at 3:50pm. I have found setting an alarm on my phone for 3:50 (or a bit later) works well to ensure that I get to it before running out of time.-->

## Quiz question from Lecture 1

> why didn't see second letter

Why was "I missed that" the right answer


## Bottleneck

Limited processing capacity

## Alex White words paper

## Bottom-up and top-down selection

Deciding which info goes hrough the bottleneck

## Remember this?

## How is info prioritized at the bottleneck?

## Reading-order prioritisation

## Consciousness and attention

Global Neuronal Workspace theory:
"Attention and consciousness are the same process"

-- David Alais' slide #40 of Consciousness lecture 2

::: notes
You're not conscious of anything except what you are attending to.
Whereas the Recurrent Processing Theory says you're conscious of the whole visual field in a rich way.
This is a hard part of consciousness to explain, because when we probe what people are seeing, it seems like they're not seeing much (change blindness)

This actually may be part of the non-selective pathway.

## DISTRACTION

## What most distracts you doing lecture?

![](images/distractionsDuringLectureCensored.png)
::: notes
Some of these are bottom-up sensory events
Some are ongoing life concerns (top-down)
Some are basic drives (hunger)
:::

## 

All day, the world makes its demands. There's so much of it, world

begging to be noticed.


![](images/LeilaChatti.jpeg){width=40%}

##

ultrawhelmed
sensorium, my self  

taxed with being a self, brimming with living’s rowdy mechanics and disruptions
unremitting, a thought flits by, then another (an unpaid bill, a jingle’s tenacious refrain)—and,
... I attend, as best I can,...  
yielding to the most persuasive god, the most recent, to each thing I say Yes? Yes!—
zealot of whatever calls me next.

::: notes
It was actually called "A poem for Sunday" and on a Sunday there can be a joy in this.
Mindfulness or living in the moment

::: notes
Computers used to freeze all the time. With a lot of advances in operating system technology

## In a future class, bump up the distraction diary to keeping phone on as normal aand recording notification checks

## CONTROLLING BOTTOM-UP SENSORY EVENTS

## Turn off phone notifications!

## Earplugs

Don't be a passive victim of your animal nature!

What do you do to shut out the world?

## Are you not going to do it because it's not cool?

![](images/masksComfortablePrincessBridge.jpg)
::: notes
Why do you wear a mask, do you have horrible scars?

## MENTIMETER: WHEN HAVE YOU BEEN MOST FOCUSED?

IRINA'S VIDEO GAMER DIES FROM FOCUS

## Find a study on how repeated events or learned events become less distracting

[.](https://www.youtube.com/embed/sXjoGtuAkNU?si=84n6LvMVW98ykm8y&amp;start=29)

The dog's bark changes rapidly and has a chaotic rhythm. If it was a constant repetition and rhythm, you'd anticipate it well and could suppress it better.

- Lecture 2
	- People have known about distraction for thousands of years
		- Buddhism. Are you a victim of your attentional mechanisms?
		- Flash a bunch of self-help book images.
		- animals for millions
	- “What in this image attracts your attention?” Gradual transition from salience to more goal-directed
- My story
	- Like many others, I spend too much time on social media.
	- Tried apps that stopped me from using the internet.
	- Fall off the wagon
	- The Pomodoro method - preserve the rewards, but delay them so you have more uninterrupted work session.
	
	Come back to dual-letters and explain left advantage
