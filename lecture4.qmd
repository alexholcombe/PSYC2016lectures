<!--sometimes have to turn multiplex false to load speaker notes -->

<!--As for the format of the quizzes, we canâ€™t sit all people in the Monday class, so I give the quiz question at the end and will explain it first thing on tuesday.  The quiz question is open until 3pm Tuesday.  For the Tuesday and Thursday class, the quiz opens at the start, but I explain it after it closes at 3:50pm. I have found setting an alarm on my phone for 3:50 (or a bit later) works well to ensure that I get to it before running out of time.-->

## Lecture 3 CLEAN-UP and REVIEW


## Quiz question from Lecture 1

> why didn't see second letter

Why was "I missed that" the right answer

## Bottom-up and top-down selection

Deciding which info goes through the bottleneck

## Remember this?

[movie](images/2targets4timesFaster.mov)

<!-- {{< video images/2targets4timesFaster.mov >}} -->

## How is info prioritized at the bottleneck?

-   Bottom-up / endogenous / stimulus-driven salience
-   Current plans
-   Automatic routines
    -   reading

## Reading-order prioritisation

::: notes
You're not conscious of anything except what you are attending to. Whereas the Recurrent Processing Theory says you're conscious of the whole visual field in a rich way. This is a hard part of consciousness to explain, because when we probe what people are seeing, it seems like they're not seeing much (change blindness)

This actually may be part of the non-selective pathway.

## DISTRACTION

## What most distracts you doing lecture?

![](images/distractionsDuringLectureCensored.png) 

::: notes 
Some of these are bottom-up sensory events Some are ongoing life concerns (top-down) Some are basic drives (hunger)

## 

All day, the world makes its demands. There's so much of it, world

begging to be noticed.

## 

ultrawhelmed sensorium, my self

taxed with being a self, brimming with living's rowdy mechanics and disruptions unremitting, a thought flits by, then another (an unpaid bill, a jingle's tenacious refrain)---and, ... I attend, as best I can,...\
yielding to the most persuasive god, the most recent, to each thing I say Yes? Yes!--- zealot of whatever calls me next.

::: notes
It was actually called "A poem for Sunday" and on a Sunday there can be a joy in this. Mindfulness or living in the moment

## Social factors

When we did that demonstration, we did it as a big group

Co-working sessions.

Shut up and write sessions

One reason team sports are great, you're not going to just stop running and let down the team

## 

Ezra Klein wrote beautifully about this situation this week in the New York Times:

Gloria Mark, a professor of information science at the University of California, Irvine, and the author of "Attention Span," started researching the way people used computers in 2004. The average time people spent on a single screen was 2.5 minutes. "I was astounded," she told me. "That was so much worse than I'd thought it would be." But that was just the beginning. By 2012, Mark and her colleagues found the average time on a single task was 75 seconds. Now it's down to about 47.

This is an acid bath for human cognition. Multitasking is mostly a myth. We can focus on one thing at a time. "It's like we have an internal whiteboard in our minds," Mark said. "If I'm working on one task, I have all the info I need on that mental whiteboard. Then I switch to email. I have to mentally erase that whiteboard and write all the information I need to do email. And just like on a real whiteboard, there can be a residue in our minds. We may still be thinking of something from three tasks ago."

## Individual differences

-   What do we know?
    -   You're going to be disappointed

::: notes
This is one of the things people are most interested in

## Demonstration: studying humans requires getting lots of data

-   Data is noisy
-   Need multiple humans or lots of trials

## Time perception mini-study

Close eyes for 34 sec

## Give your answer

https://forms.gle/yy3NXtMfXxJESzzR9

-   How many seconds do you think that was?
-   Ask your neighbor how long they thought. Enter the average of your two numbers

## To find out how accurate time perception is, averaged people together

-   We found out that for the average person here, today, it was \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
-   If we had taken just number

## Sources of individual differences

-   Stable
-   Temporary (day, month, year)

## Sources of individual differences

-   Stable
-   Temporary (day, month, year) vs. stable
-   Motivation
    -   Stable
    -   Temporary: To do well in that particular study, or on that day
-   Understood instructions versus didn't

## Sources of individual differences

-   Continuum, neurodiversity
-   What is the "normal range"?
    -   No objective answer usually
    -   Clinicians have to define it in terms of impairment of culturally-expected functioning

## In one of these classes, vary the distraction diary to keeping phone on as normal aand recording notification checks

## CONTROLLING BOTTOM-UP SENSORY EVENTS

## Turn off phone notifications!

You might be saying I really need to co ce trade on this, but millions years evolution is saying otherwise, that you need to keep your ears turned on

## Earplugs

Don't be a passive victim of your animal nature!

What do you do to shut out the world?

## MENTIMETER: WHEN HAVE YOU BEEN MOST FOCUSED?

IRINA'S VIDEO GAMER DIES FROM FOCUS

## Find a study on how repeated events or learned events become less distracting

[.](https://www.youtube.com/embed/sXjoGtuAkNU?si=84n6LvMVW98ykm8y&start=29)

The dog's bark changes rapidly and has a chaotic rhythm. If it was a constant repetition and rhythm, you'd anticipate it well and could suppress it better.

## QUOTE

> To pay attention, this is our endless and proper work

-   Lecture 2

    -   People have known about distraction for thousands of years
        -   Buddhism. Are you a victim of your attentional mechanisms?
        -   Flash a bunch of self-help book images.
        -   animals for millions
    -   "What in this image attracts your attention?" Gradual transition from salience to more goal-directed

-   My story

    -   Like many others, I spend too much time on social media.
    -   Tried apps that stopped me from using the internet.
    -   Fall off the wagon
    -   The Pomodoro method - preserve the rewards, but delay them so you have more uninterrupted work session.

    Come back to dual-letters and explain left advantage
