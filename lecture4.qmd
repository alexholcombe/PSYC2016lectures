<!--As for the format of the quizzes, we canâ€™t sit all people in the Monday class, so I give the quiz question at the end and will explain it first thing on tuesday.  The quiz question is open until 3pm Tuesday.  For the Tuesday and Thursday class, the quiz opens at the start, but I explain it after it closes at 3:50pm. I have found setting an alarm on my phone for 3:50 (or a bit later) works well to ensure that I get to it before running out of time.-->

<!--2023 notes I still had time at the end of the lecture despite 5 questions from the audience and hamming up the change blindness videos. But don't forget to go very slow in the syllogism and Grand illusion stuff!

## Lecture 3 student question {background-image="images/puzzledFace.png" background-opacity="0.08"}

> I'm a bit confused after that lecture. If i walk into a room and just look at nothing in particular, am I bottlenecking a particular feature, or am i simulatenously taking everything in?

You are:

-   Simultaneously processing color, motion, but not their combination
-   Extensively processing (through the bottleneck) one or a few objects at the location of your attention
-   Doing additional processing that we don't understand through your non-selective pathway

::: notes :::

Which is thought to be true?

A. Combining features from different feature dimensions requires attention
B. The ventral pathway is specialized for location information
C. Detecting an odd feature within one feature dimension requires attention
D. Peripheral vision is mostly better than central vision

## Argument for "the grand illusion" {background-image="images/threeWiseMonkeys/640.jpg" background-opacity="0.05"}
<BR>

-   **Premise 1**. If you visually experience most of a scene's objects, you will notice major changes to them.

-   **Premise 2**. You don't detect major changes to most objects in a scene (in the blank-screen sandwich movies).

-   **Conclusion**. Therefore, you *don't* visually experience most objects in a scene.

## Review of the argument (now in essay format in case that helps) {background-image="images/threeWiseMonkeys/640.jpg" background-opacity="0.07"}

[The "grand illusion" argument]{.underline}: if we really did experience everything in the scene, we would quickly detect changes to the objects in the scene. So, because we don't quickly detect many changes to the scene (change blindness), we must *not* really experience everything.

But the grand illusion argument is actually *not* a great argument; the first part that says that if we really did experience everything, we would quickly detect changes. Maybe we really do experience everything but we don't have a comparison process that's always comparing everything. Or maybe we really do experience everything but we don't have a representation of the scene a short time ago, so we can't do the comparison. In other words, the idea that "if we really did experience everything, we would quickly detect changes" may be false.

-   You can still believe there is a "grand illusion" of visual experience, but change blindness is not a good argument for it.

## Peripheral vision {background-image="images/threeWiseMonkeys/640.jpg" background-opacity="0.05"}
<BR>

Good experimenters ensure that the object is visible in the periphery.

-   If the object is not visible in the periphery, need *overt* attention to the location, not just *covert* attention
    -   Unsurprising that this can't be done at all locations at once!

I've conditioned you to say "bottleneck" but in this particular demonstration, the change is quite small.

This is actually a fly brain, but this aspect of the architecture is very similar to our own.

-   Motion detectors respond to flicker

::: notes :::

Why is the blank screen in a blank-screen sandwich video important? (Choose all correct options)

A. It discombobulates via increasing arousal
B. It shortens the picture duration 
C. It stimulates motion/flicker detectors in every location
D. It hurts peripheral vision, making the change harder to detect.

-   "Mud splashes" almost as good as blank screen
-   Motion detectors misdirect attention

## {background-image="images/puzzledFace.png" background-opacity="0.08"}

> What made the mud splashes more salient than the white road lines?

  -   They are bigger and thus stimulate the motion detectors more strongly
  -   They are more different to their surround (parallel bottom-up attention processing)
