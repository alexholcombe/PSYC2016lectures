<!--As for the format of the quizzes, we canâ€™t sit all people in the Monday class, so I give the quiz question at the end and will explain it first thing on tuesday.  The quiz question is open until 3pm Tuesday.  For the Tuesday and Thursday class, the quiz opens at the start, but I explain it after it closes at 3:50pm. I have found setting an alarm on my phone for 3:50 (or a bit later) works well to ensure that I get to it before running out of time.-->

<!--2023 notes I still had time at the end of the lecture despite 5 questions from the audience and hamming up the change blindness videos. But don't forget to go very slow in the syllogism and Grand illusion stuff!

## Argument for "the grand illusion" {background-image="images/threeWiseMonkeys/640.jpg" background-opacity="0.05"}
<BR>

-   **Premise 1**. If you visually experience most of a scene's objects, you will notice major changes to them.

-   **Premise 2**. You don't detect major changes to most objects in a scene (in the blank-screen sandwich movies).

-   **Conclusion**. Therefore, you *don't* visually experience most objects in a scene.

If A, then B.  

B is not true.

Therefore, A is not true.

::: notes :::
A bad habit that most of us have is that we rarely spell out the reasons for our beliefs very carefully.
If you negate the consequent, the antecedent must be false.
If A, then B.  Not B. Therefore, not A.

Grand illusion argument logic

I agree with the conclusion
Premise 1 is false
Premise 2 is false
Premise 2 does not negate the consequent of Premise 1.
Something else.

**Premise 1**. If you visually experience most of a scene's objects, you will notice major changes to them.

**Premise 2**. You don't detect major changes to most objects in a scene (in the blank-screen sandwich movies).

**Conclusion**. Therefore, you don't visually experience most objects in a scene.

Researchers have mostly contested premise 1.

## Needed to detect a change {background-image="images/threeWiseMonkeys/640.jpg" background-opacity="0.05"}
<BR>

1. Internal representations of the object before and after the change.

2. A process that compares the before representation to the after.

3. A process that calls attention to, or brings into conscious awareness, the comparison results.

Change blindness -> "the grand illusion"
:::

-   You can still believe there is a "grand illusion" of visual experience, but change blindness is not a good argument for it.

<BR>

-   There is *other* evidence that we only have access to a few visual objects

## Peripheral vision {background-image="images/threeWiseMonkeys/640.jpg" background-opacity="0.05"}
<BR>

Good experimenters ensure that the object is visible in the periphery.

-   If the object is not visible in the periphery, need *overt* attention to the location, not just covert attention
    -   Unsurprising that this can't be done at all locations at once!

::: notes :::
I've conditioned you to say "bottleneck" but in this particular demonstration, the change is quite small.

<BR>

![](images/changeBlindnessPants.gif)

-   Motion detectors respond to flicker
-   If there's motion everywhere, there might as well be motion nowhere
    -  Odd motion detector response no longer makes change location salient
    
::: notes :::
Motion no longer informs us of the change

## {background-image="images/hardQuiz.jpg" background-opacity="0.6"}

::: notes :::

Why is the blank screen in a blank-screen sandwich video important? (Choose all correct options)

A. It discombobulates via increasing arousal
B. It shortens the image duration 
C. It stimulates motion/flicker detectors in every location
D. It hurts peripheral vision, making the change harder to detect.

Why are gradual changes hard to find?

-   They don't stimulate motion detectors
