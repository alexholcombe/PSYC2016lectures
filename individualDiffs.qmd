<!--As for the format of the quizzes, we canâ€™t sit all people in the Monday class, so I give the quiz question at the end and will explain it first thing on tuesday.  The quiz question is open until 3pm Tuesday.  For the Tuesday and Thursday class, the quiz opens at the start, but I explain it after it closes at 3:50pm. I have found setting an alarm on my phone for 3:50 (or a bit later) works well to ensure that I get to it before running out of time.-->

Be able to explain why it inspired the "grand illusion of visual experience" theory

![](images/changeBlindnessPants.gif)


## Argument for the "grand illusion" {background-image="images/threeWiseMonkeys/640.jpg" background-opacity="0.05"}
<BR>

-   **Premise 1**. If you visually experience most of a scene's objects, you will notice major changes to them.

-   **Premise 2**. You don't detect major changes to most objects in a scene (in the blank-screen sandwich movies).

-   **Conclusion**. Therefore, you don't visually experience most objects in a scene.

If A, then B.  

Not B.

Therefore, not A.

::: notes :::
If you negate the consequent, the antecedent must be false.
If A, then B.  Not B. Therefore, not A.

## Menti.com {background-image="images/threeWiseMonkeys/640.jpg" background-opacity="0.05"}

What do you think of the argument?

::: notes :::
I agree with the conclusion
Premise 1 is false
Premise 2 is false
Premise 2 does not negate the consequent of Premise 1.
Something else.

<BR>

**Premise 1**. If you visually experience most of a scene's objects, you will notice major changes to them.

**Premise 2**. You don't detect major changes to most objects in a scene (in the blank-screen sandwich movies).

**Conclusion**. Therefore, you don't visually experience most objects in a scene.

::: notes :::
Researchers have mostly contested premise 1.
:::

## Needed to detect a change {background-image="images/threeWiseMonkeys/640.jpg" background-opacity="0.05"}

1. Internal representations of the object before and after the change.

2. A process that compares the before representation to the after.

3. A process that calls attention to, or brings into conscious awareness, the comparison results.

-   The argument for the "grand illusion" is not good

## Explaining change blindness

<BR>
-   Focused attention is needed to detect change

Could be needed to hold onto the old representaiton.
Or to do the comparison.

Change blindness -> "grand illusion"
:::

-   You can still think that there is a "grand illusion" of visual experience, but change blindness is not a good argument for it.
-   There is other evidence that we only have access to a few visual objects
    -   Ned Block still thinks that phenomenal content overflows cognitive access.

:::

## Peripheral vision {background-image="images/threeWiseMonkeys/640.jpg" background-opacity="0.05"}

Good experiments ensure that the object is visible in the periphery.

-   If the object is not visible in the periphery, need *overt* attention to the location, not just covert attention

::: notes :::
I've conditioned you to say "bottleneck" but in this particular demonstration, the change is quite small.

## Poor peripheral vision

::: notes :::

What is the effect of the blank screen in a blank-screen sandwich video? (Choose all correct options)

A. It makes the change easier to detect
B. Without it, the change occurs too fast to see
C. It makes the change harder to detect
D. It hurts peripheral vision, making the change harder to detect.

## How is info prioritized at the bottleneck?

-   Bottom-up / endogenous / stimulus-driven salience
-   Current plans
-   Automatic routines
    -   reading

## Reading-order prioritisation

::: notes
You're not conscious of anything except what you are attending to. Whereas the Recurrent Processing Theory says you're conscious of the whole visual field in a rich way. This is a hard part of consciousness to explain, because when we probe what people are seeing, it seems like they're not seeing much (change blindness)

This actually may be part of the non-selective pathway.

## Sources of individual differences

-   Stable
-   Temporary (day, month, year) vs. stable
-   Motivation
    -   Stable
    -   Temporary: To do well in that particular study, or on that day
-   Understood instructions versus didn't

## Sources of individual differences

-   Continuum, neurodiversity
-   What is the "normal range"?
    -   No objective answer usually
    -   Clinicians have to define it in terms of impairment of culturally-expected functioning

        -   Buddhism. Are you a victim of your attentional mechanisms?
        -   Flash a bunch of self-help book images.
        -   animals for millions
    -   "What in this image attracts your attention?" Gradual transition from salience to more goal-directed

-   My story

    -   Like many others, I spend too much time on social media.
    -   Tried apps that stopped me from using the internet.
    -   Fall off the wagon
    -   The Pomodoro method - preserve the rewards, but delay them so you have more uninterrupted work session.
