# PSYC2016lectures

These lectures are rendered to e.g. https://alexholcombe.github.io/PSYC2016lectures

This happens thanks to configuring the repository to render to docs/, adding a .nojekyll file, and telling Github to publish from the docs directory, as all explained here:

https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#render-to-docs

So whenever I push to github here, the new version will be published.
